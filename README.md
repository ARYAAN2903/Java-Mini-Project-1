## Hospital Bed Management System
### Objective:
Hospital Bed management system is an organized computerized system designed to deal with day-today operations of hospital beds. However, when running a large medical centre or chain of hospitals, We understand that bed tracking is more challenging than it seems. Poor bed visibility, delayed bed maintenance, and a lack of centralized information can make tracking available beds difficult. Some of the challenges faced by the hospitals today are use of manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. One can easily find out if a specific bed is available in a ward.By automating hospital bed management systems and providing bed visibility, clinical staff are no longer forced to rely on outdated information or error-prone manual records.

The hospital bed management is designed for hospital to replace their existing manual system.
The new system is to control the following information:

1.patient information.

2.room availability.

3.bed visibility.

These services are provided in graphic user interface in an efficient manner to reduce the time and resources currently required for such tasks.

### Technologies used:
1.javafx scenebuilder for ui desiging

2.mysql workbench for database

3.intelliJ Idea for connectivity.
